LagoNet is a simple 3-layer Convolutional Neural Network designed to distinguish individuals with lagophthalmos from those who do not. It runs with an 80:10:10 split between training, validation, and testing sets. The 1,008 total input facial images were 256x256 RGB photos. The model expects the images to be stored in numpy datasets. By configuring the dataset paths correctly, this model can be run in Google Colab, among other environments.
